# captainstarpants
Name:  Captain Starpants
Concept:
Vertical scrolling space shooter with wacky and OP power ups and huge ridiculous bosses and a variety of silly enemies
Easy to pick up and play, challenge is in achievements, score, and unlocks
Space shooter style -- ship design matches personality of various protagonists
Ship loses power ups instead of death, but you have to accumulate stars in order to unlock new levels — stars for killing enemies, score, and picking up items — and you need your powers to achieve big scores, kill all the enemies, get all items, so it’s possible to finish the level, but not score enough to advance
Bosses are former friends of main character Captain Starpants
Defeating a boss unlocks that character
Characters have differing starting stats and cosmetics and a different alternate attack
Captain Starpants - intrepid space explorer
KRUTON - Robot destroyer
Shell Bell - space mermaid
Princess Ebby - presumptive heir to the universe
Angel Lis - extra-dimensional being
Jazzy Jen - latest winner of the pangalactic dance contest
